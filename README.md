## Hello, world!
Hi, I’m Pam! I'm a multi-disciplinary designer with 4 years’ combined experience in computational research projects, spatial network analysis, masterplanning, and architecture specialising in mixed-use retail-led developments across the United States, Southeast Asia, India, and China. I graduated from Curtin University with a Bachelor of Applied Science (Architectural Science). I enjoy exploring tools for thought, web development, green buildings, and computational design.

## What I'm up to
- I’m currently improving my [Python](https://www.python.org/) knowledge via edX courses.
- I'm also working on a project involving [Geographic Information Systems (GIS)](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/) and [Spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA)](https://sdna.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna/).
