## Hello, world!
Hi, I’m Pam! I'm a multi-disciplinary designer with 4 years’ combined experience in computational research projects, spatial network analysis, masterplanning, and architecture specialising in mixed-use retail-led developments across the United States, Southeast Asia, India, and China. I graduated from [Curtin University](https://www.curtin.edu.au/) with a [Bachelor of Applied Science (Architectural Science)](https://study.curtin.edu.au/offering/course-ug-bachelor-of-applied-science-architectural-science--b-arch/). I enjoy exploring tools for thought, web development, green buildings, and computational design.

## What I'm up to
- I’m currently improving my [Python](https://www.python.org/) knowledge via edX courses.
- I'm also working on a project involving [GIS](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/) and [sDNA](https://sdna.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna/).
